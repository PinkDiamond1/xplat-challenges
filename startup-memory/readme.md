# Startup time

This challenge measures how long it takes to get an application fully started. The code being
executed is https://ahfarmer.github.io/calculator/. The reason is that all resources are
loaded from the same domain (no ads, tracking, etc.) and it is built in React, which is widely
used.
The applications are compiled in Release mode (when applciable) and launched from the command
line. The executions is recorded with Camtasia and the time is measured from the moment the
cursor dissappears from the line to the moment the application is fully rendered.
