# IPC

The IPC tests measure the speed of the following scenarios:

- [x] Renderer -> Main -> Renderer
- [ ] Renderer A -> Renderer B -> Renderer A (via main or message channels)

The tests are "na√Øve". What ever number of messages you indicate will be sent
without any type of optimization (like batching or delaying to not fill the queue).

If you have a chatty IPC, you usually want to have some type of mechanism to
do this but in this benchmark we are just testing "defaults".

For Electron there are 2 tests: using node integration or the more secure option that
uses [contextIsolation](https://www.electronjs.org/docs/latest/security/context-isolation/)
